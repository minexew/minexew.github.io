Inspired by the fascinating work done on projects such as [StarCraft for Pandora](https://pyra-handheld.com/boards/threads/starcraft.73844/), [pokeruby](https://github.com/pret/pokeruby) and [Devilution](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution), I set out today to look into the executable of [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition).
The end goal is to derive a C codebase which could be compiled to obtain an executable functionally equivalent to the original. This would facilitate, among others
 - understanding of the game architecture
 - native porting to other platforms
 - source-level modding (as opposed to in-memory hacks ala [HoMM 3 HD](https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/))

As for the tools, I expect to use radare2 heavily, along with the RetDec decompiler.
Of course, a staple of the RE community is IDA Pro along with its C decompiler. I intend to evaluate its capabilities, but due to licensing reason, optimally the final work-flow would be based entirely on free software. 
Nevertheless, the entire flow will be heavily data driven (and well-defined), which should allow a choice among multiple tools for each step.

Because everybody loves pictures, let's look at a picture of what *should* work according to my naive, childish imagination:

One questions that remains to be answered is whether it is worth it to aim for a bit-perfect reproduction of the original executable. This would of course imply the need to use the original tools. At this point, I haven't attempted to figure out what compiler version was used.
